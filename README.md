# agenda-calendar-jira

an app that on the left side displays a calendar with my agenda. All items must be drag and doppable. Calendar should look like a proper calendar with Days of the week on the top starting by Monday ending with Sunday, and the lines should represent 30 minutes slots, starting at 5 am in the morning. All items in the calendar such as meetings, appointments should be drag and droppable. 
On the right side, I want a list of JIRA tickets with Epic, Key, Summary, Status, Assignee, Reporter and Story Points. The tickets are drag and droppable to re-arrange their order, but also should be drag and droppable towards the calendar, and in that case it should generate an appointment in the calendar in the cell where we dropped the JIRA ticket.
